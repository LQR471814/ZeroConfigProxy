# ZeroConfigProxy

***Sick and tired of disabled proxy configurations on chromebook laptops? Well fear no more! Everything in this proxy is handled server side, hiding the server's identity from the client and the client's identity from the server***

Note: this repository is being replaced and rewritten in golang, you can get it [here](https://github.com/LQR471814/webproxy)!
